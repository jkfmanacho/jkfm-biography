            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone had told me five years ago I’d be writing my life story, I would have laughed.<sup>1</sup> Mostly because I was too busy trying how to get out of boredom in the midst of a pandemic.<sup>2</sup> Yet here I am, so might as well set the scene.<sup>3</sup> In the summerish island of <b>Romblon</b>, the world welcomed a little girl.<sup>4</sup> I was the second-born of the family, only two years apart from my sister.<sup>5</sup> My life as a child was like a feather on a breeze as I grew up with sand under my feet, wind in my hair, and fueled by afternoon naps.<sup>6</sup> I spent my formative years under the care of my grandparents in Odiongan, as my parents were working in Manila.<sup>7</sup> By the age of four, I moved in the city with them, and that’s where my life really began.<sup>8</sup> My mother did all her best to raise my sister and I while my father was overseas.<sup>9</sup> In return, I learned how to excel academically, holding gratitude for my parents in my heart.<sup>10</sup> <i>“Gifted child”</i> they call me, but honestly, I was just afraid of the look of disappointment from them.<sup>11</sup> Nevertheless, it served as my source of motivation.<sup>12</sup> Contrary to all I’ve said so far, I was also quite the rowdy kid like most, picking fights and spouting snarky remarks.<sup>13</sup> At that stage of my life, it was more appropriate to refer to me as someone with a strong character.<sup>14</sup> <b>My childhood years were as typical as a flower to a butterfly</b>.<sup>15</sup> I scraped my knee, painted my nails, had crushes on Disney characters, and lived my life with my head in the clouds.<sup>16</sup> For a girl like me, the world seemed so big.<sup>17</sup> And of course, I dreamed bigger.<sup>18</sup> I imagined myself doing a lot of things, settling on a bunch of career paths, you’d think I’ve lived a lot of lifetimes.<sup>19</sup> I think that was the bliss of my childhood – I had the future ahead of me, and all I had to do was live.<sup>20</sup>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to thirteen and the following years, I was different from the girl I once was.<sup>1</sup> I’ve experienced the ups and downs of life: loss, happiness, desolation, contentment, and such.<sup>2</sup> I’ve tasted what it’s like to fail, to rise from it, and to carry the lessons it left me.<sup>3</sup> Still, I’ve been told that it’s only the beginning.<sup>4</sup> That idea had struck my will and left my determination wavering.<sup>5</sup> <b>I could describe my teenage years as a stage full of contemplation</b>.<sup>6</sup> I was exploring, discovering things, and unfolding more aspects of myself.<sup>7</sup> Puberty came through like a truck.<sup>8</sup> I was emotional, distraught, and every little thing seemed to enrage me.<sup>9</sup> Looking back, I never quite understood why I was like that before.<sup>10</sup> I could only laugh and tell myself I was just a sensitive kid.<sup>11</sup> Junior High School was fun as I formed stronger friendships and tried to hone my academic excellence.<sup>12</sup> If there was anything that stayed the same, it was my vast imagination.<sup>13</sup> I used it as fuel to pursue different hobbies.<sup>14</sup> <b>I found my love for the arts, tried to create mine, and it felt right</b>.<sup>15</sup> I knew I always had a colorful vision on different things, and I’m glad that spark never burned out.<sup>16</sup> It was the only thing I could hold onto as I pushed through the remaining years of my teens.<sup>17</sup> Then came Senior High School, the moment I realized every decision I make will determine my future.<sup>18</sup> I tried my best to masquerade my anxiety, and reassured myself that I’ll figure it out when the time comes.<sup>19</sup> Although the feeling of security could only do so much; people would ask me about my path to college and all I could do was smile and tell them I’ll take anything I’ll end up to.<sup>20</sup> Despite the growing pressure, I finished the last two years of high school with colors and ready to take on what’s ahead.<sup>21</sup>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College applications were hectic.<sup>1</sup> I studied for entrance exams, filed requests for whatever requirements I was asked for, and I thought the errands I went through were never ending.<sup>2</sup> In May of 2023, the threads of fate led me to <b>University of the East</b>, under the program of <b>Information Technology</b>.<sup>3</sup> Why, you may ask?<sup>4</sup> I never really knew what to do (as disappointing as it sounds), so I thought about being practical.<sup>5</sup> I had the choice to pursue my artistry, but I was firm on my decision that it would only stay as an interest.<sup>6</sup> I brushed off the worry in my chest and officially entered my college life with my head up high.<sup>7</sup> First semester of my freshman year went smoothly, I easily made friends and quickly picked up on my studies.<sup>8</sup> <b>Just when I thought I already know everything there is about the world, it got bigger</b>.<sup>9</sup> Turns out I still have a lot to learn and more things to discover.<sup>10</sup> I’ve failed exams, spent all-nighters, hung out with friends to places I haven’t been before, and unexpectedly, fallen in love.<sup>11</sup> Now that I’m halfway through, I remember the starting line, the nervous energy, the way everything felt so new.<sup>12</sup> Thinking back, it feels like a different lifetime.<sup>13</sup> I've seen things I never expected, learned lessons I couldn't have imagined.<sup>14</sup> And you know what?<sup>15</sup> The fire's still there.<sup>16</sup> Maybe it's not the same wild blaze as before, but it burns steady now, fueled by experience.<sup>17</sup> <b>It's a different kind of fire, a quieter strength</b>.<sup>18</sup> I'm not just trying to get to the end anymore; I'm determined to make the most of every single moment that's left.<sup>19</sup> The funny thing is, I used to worry so much about what was coming next.<sup>20</sup> But now?<sup>21</sup> I don't know, and that's okay.<sup>22</sup> <b>This life is a story waiting to be written, and I can’t wait to see what happens next</b>.<sup>23</sup>
